    <p>
      This demonstrates the clickable region of the an element, in this case a
      <code>span</code> with a nested <code>img</code> element and a number of
      nested, absolutely positioned <code>div</code> elements.
    </p>
    <p>
      The clickable region of the <code>span</code> is the bounding box of the
      span itself, the bounding box of its child <code>img</code> and those of
      its <code>div</code> children, even of <code>div.blue</code> which is
      disconnected from the rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      The bounding box of <code>div.green</code> is removed from the region,
      because it's not a descendant of the <code>span</code>. The bounding box
      of <code>div.red</code> is also removed from the region despite it being a
      descendant of the <code>span</code>. This is because it has a click event
      listener that calls <code>stopPropagation()</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The bounding box of <code>div.yellow</code> is <b>not</b> removed from the
      region despite it <b>not</b> being a descendant. This is because it has
      <code>pointer-events: none</code> so it is "invisible" to click events.
    </p>
    <p>
      The clickable region of an element can be constructed with the following
      procedure:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Take the union of the bounding boxes of the element itself and it's
        descendants, a potentially disconnected set.
      </li>
      <li>
        From that region, remove the bounding boxes of the descendants with a
        click event listener that calls <code>stopPropagation()</code>.
      </li>
      <li>
        Then, remove the bounding boxes of the non-descendants that are
        positioned on top and does <b>not</b> have
        <code>pointer-events: none</code>.
      </li>
      <li>
        The result is the region of the page where a click event will propagate
        to the given element.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      The <code>stopPropagation()</code> case is very likely too difficult to
      recognize with static analysis. We would have to either do actual runtime
      tests or do static analysis of the JavaScript that gets loaded by the
      page.
    </p>
    <p>
      For that reason, our goal will be to determine the
      <i>potentially clickable regions</i> assuming all descendants allow
      propagation.
